**Noctua** is my tailored pentesting distribution, crafted to be absolutely minimal and cater to my specific needs. Built on Debian 12, it serves as a super-solid base with only the most important tools I personally love and rely on. Noctua isn’t flashy or bloated—just sharp, efficient, and reliable (and is free from glowing kali mirrors :)) ).

**Disclaimer**: This setup prioritizes functionality for lab use and OSCP preparation. Proper OPSEC (e.g., non-root privileges, firewall rules) will be addressed in future updates.

### **Design Considerations**

- **Minimalist by Design**: No unnecessary tools or extras—just a lean setup to maximize stability and reduce the attack surface. \

- **Headless First**: Optimized for headless operation, with an optional i3 desktop environment for lightweight GUI needs. 

- **Built on Debian 12**: Selected for its unmatched reliability, long-term support, and security-first approach.  

- **Disposable Machines**: Intended for spinning up fresh instances per engagement, ensuring clean, isolated environments.

* ***Source-Based Philosophy**: Tools are installed directly from source for maximum transparency, control, and reliability. This ensures no dependency roulette or questionable upstream packages.

- **Tailored to Perfection**: Crafted specifically for my workflow but may serve as inspiration for others.

- **A Foundation for Customization**: Noctua is not a complete toolkit—it’s a foundation. A base to build your own custom pentesting distribution, tailored to your workflow and preferences.

Noctua isn’t trying to compete with mainstream pentesting distros—it’s a personal tool, focused on precision and results. If it inspires you to rethink or streamline your setup, that’s just a bonus.

### **Why Noctua Over Kali?**

- **No Bloat**: Unlike Kali, which ships with hundreds of tools you may never use, Noctua keeps it minimal and lets you decide what to include.
- **Transparent & Secure**: All tools are installed from source, giving you full control and visibility over your environment.
- **Tailored to You**: Kali tries to be everything for everyone, but Noctua is a starting point—a foundation you can customize to match your needs.
- **Stable & Reliable**: Built on Debian 12, known for its stability and long-term support, so you’re not dealing with broken tools during critical moments.

**Noctua isn’t here to make noise; it’s here to deliver results.**
